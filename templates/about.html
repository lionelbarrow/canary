                <p>Of course not! These predictions are only statistical guesses,
                and there are any number of ways in which they could go wrong.
                Most obviously, this model makes predictions based off the
                aggregate actions of the people buying and selling US treasury bonds.
                If something happens that those people did not anticipate, such
                as a natural disaster, then there is no way for the model to
                anticipate it either.</p>

                <h3>Who made this site?</h3>
                <p class="p1">This site was mostly made by
                <u><a href="http://www.lionelbarrow.com/">Lionel Barrow</a></u>
                and Jack Barrow in August, 2011. Lionel has a BA in mathematics from
                Bard; Jack is studying economics and mathematics at Loyola
                University Maryland. They first became interested in predicting recessions
                in 2008, when the Great Recession came close to forcing them
                out of college.
